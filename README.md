# Hi there

> :warning: All repositories outside my [Forgejo instance at home](https://git.zyria.de/) (if any) are just mirrors mainly for working together!

**Because I don't want to be dependent on a Microsoft service, I migrated all repositories to reliable services.**

- personal github alternative: [Forgejo instance at home](https://www.zyria.de/git/)
- business github alternative: [Forgejo instance at work](https://www.casa-due-pur.de/git/)
- external infrastructure: [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ricariel)

Here i store all my private used repositories. Most of them are private and
hopefully not accessable by public.

Feel free to use them.
